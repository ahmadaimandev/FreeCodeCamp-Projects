1. box-sizing selector
* This elements ensure that will include padding and border in their specified width and height

2. CSS positioning
-> in browser css allows you to position the element by using this 5 values:

* static = default positioning all element. won't able to move it around with top, right, left or bottom.

* absolute = the elements taken out of the normal flow of the document, and then position is determined
by the top, right, bottom and left properties.

* relative = elements still positioned according to normal flow of the document. but the value 
top, left, bottom, and right values become active.

* sticky

* fixed = makes the element fixed to the page no matter where the user scrolls on to on the page.

-> once the position is set, you can move the element around by setting a pixel or percentage values
for one or more of the top, right, left, bottom properties.
