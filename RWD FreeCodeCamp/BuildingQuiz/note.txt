-> This is accomplished by semantic elements.

-> Header elements will be used to introduce the page , as well as provide Navigation menu
-> main element will contain the core content of page.

-> SVG
* A useful property SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) is that contain a path attribute which allows the image to be scaled 
without affecting the resolution of the image.

Example Code: 
img {
  width: max(250px, 25vw);
}
explanation:
based on example, the width image will be 250px if the viewport width less than 1000 pixels,
if the viewport width is greater that 1000 pixels, the width image will be 25vw
this is because 25vw = 25% of the viewport width

Child combinator
-> The child combinator > is used between selectors to target only elements
that match the second selector and are a direct child of the first selector.
-> This can be helpful when you have deeply nested elements and want to control scope of styling.

-> role attribute

to assistive technologies.
* role attribute is part of Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) and accepts preset values.
