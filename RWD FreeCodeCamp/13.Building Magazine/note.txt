Lazy loading
-> lazy to tell the browser not to fetch the image resources until it's needed (as
in, when the user scrolls the image view).

-> As an additional benefit, lazy loaded elements will not load until the non-lazy elements are loaded-
this means users with slow internet connection can view the content of your page without having to wait for the images to load.
