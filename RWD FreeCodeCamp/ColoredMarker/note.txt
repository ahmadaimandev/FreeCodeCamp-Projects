==> Margin
     ==> margin: <top/bottom> <left/right>
     example:
     margin: 10px 20px;
     explain:
     margin-top and margin-bottom: 10px
     margin-left and margin right: 20px

==> Padding
    ==> padding: <top/bottom> <left/right>
     example:
     padding: 10px 20px;
     explain:
     padding-top and padding-bottom: 10px
     padding-left and padding-right: 20px

==> Multiple Classes
     ==> Multiple classes can be added to an element by listing them in the class attribute and
     seperating them with a space.
     example:
     <div class="animal dog"></div>

==> Colors
     ==> There are two main color models:
     1. additive RGB (red, green, blue) - used in electronic devices
       - In additive RGB color model, primary colors are color that, when combined, create pure white.
       - But for this to happen, each color needs to be at its highest intensity.

     2. subtractive CMYK (cyan, magenta, yellow, black) - model  used in print

     ==> During this tutorial, we work with RGB model. This mean color begin as black, and
     change as different levels of red, gree, and blue are introduced.

     ==> RGB function accepts values, or arguments, for red, green and blue and produces a color.
     ==> Each red, gree, and blue value is a number from 0 --> 255
        ==> 0 mean there's 0% of that color and its black
        ==> 255 means there's 100% of that color.

==> Secondary colors
     ==> Secondary colors are colors you get when you combine primary colors.

==> Tertiary colors
     ==> Tertiary colors are created by combining a primary with a nearby secondary color 
    example:
    background-color: rgb(255, 127, 0)
