==> Multiple Classes
     ==> Multiple classes can be added to an element by listing them in the class attribute and
     seperating them with a space.
     example:
     <div class="animal dog"></div>

==> Colors
     ==> There are two main color models:
     1. additive RGB (red, green, blue) - used in electronic devices
     2. subtractive CMYK (cyan, magenta, yellow, black) - model  used in print

     ==> During this tutorial, we work with RGB model. This mean color begin as black, and
     change as different levels of red, gree, and blue are introduced.
