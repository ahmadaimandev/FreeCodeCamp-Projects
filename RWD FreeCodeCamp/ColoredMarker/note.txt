==> Margin
     ==> margin: <top/bottom> <left/right>
     example:
     margin: 10px 20px;
     explain:
     margin-top and margin-bottom: 10px
     margin-left and margin right: 20px

==> Padding
    ==> padding: <top/bottom> <left/right>
     example:
     padding: 10px 20px;
     explain:
     padding-top and padding-bottom: 10px
     padding-left and padding-right: 20px

==> Multiple Classes
     ==> Multiple classes can be added to an element by listing them in the class attribute and
     seperating them with a space.
     example:
     <div class="animal dog"></div>

==> Colors
     ==> There are two main color models:
     1. additive RGB (red, green, blue) - used in electronic devices
       - In additive RGB color model, primary colors are color that, when combined, create pure white.
       - But for this to happen, each color needs to be at its highest intensity.

     2. subtractive CMYK (cyan, magenta, yellow, black) - model  used in print

     ==> During this tutorial, we work with RGB model. This mean color begin as black, and
     change as different levels of red, gree, and blue are introduced.

     ==> RGB function accepts values, or arguments, for red, green and blue and produces a color.
     ==> Each red, gree, and blue value is a number from 0 --> 255
        ==> 0 mean there's 0% of that color and its black
        ==> 255 means there's 100% of that color.

==> Secondary colors
     ==> Secondary colors are colors you get when you combine primary colors.

==> Tertiary colors
     ==> Tertiary colors are created by combining a primary with a nearby secondary color 
    example:
    background-color: rgb(255, 127, 0)

==> What is color wheel?
      ==> color wheel is a circle where similar color, or hues, are near each other, and different ones are futher apart.
      ==> Two colors that are opposite from each other on the color wheel are called complementary colors. 
      ==> If two complementary colors are combined, it produce gray. But.. when it placed side-by-side, these colors produce
          strong visual contrast and appear brighter.

==> Apply the color in CSS
      ==> A very common way is by apply the color with hexadecimal or hex values.
      ==> Seems complicated. but it's just another form of RGB values.
      ==> Hex color starts with (#) character and take six characters from 0-9 and A-F.
      The first pair of characters represent red, the second pair is green and the third is blue
      For example: #00FF00
      Explaination:
      --> 00 is 0% of that color
      --> FF is 100% 
      --> Translates: 0% red, 100% green and 0% blue == rgb(0, 255, 0)

      Base 10 / Decimal Value = 0 --> 9
      Base 16 / Hexadecimal Value = 0 --> then A --> F

      ==> HSL or hue, saturation and lightness also another way to represent color
      ==> HSL function accepts 3 values:
      ==> a number from 0 --> 360 for hue.
      ==> a percentage from 0 --> 100 for saturation.
      ==> a percentage from 0 --> 100 for lightness.

      ==> Gradient function let's you control the direction of the transition along a line, and which colors are used.
      ==> linear-gradient function actually creates an image element. and usually it paired with
      background property which can accept an image as a value.
