1. Variable in CSS
- variable declaration begin with two dashes (--)
example: --variable-name: value;

How to use?
- put the variable name in the parentheses with var in front of them like this:
example: var(--variable-name);

2. fallback value
- The property is use when there's a problem with the variable.
example: var(--variable-name, fallback-value);

3. CSS gradient
- gradient in CSS are a way to transition between color across the distance
of an element. They are applied for the background property and 
syntax looks like this: 

example:
gradient-type(
  color1,
  color2
);

explanation
-> color1 is solid at the top, color2 is solid at the bottom,
-> and in between it transitions evenly from one to the next

- Gradient can use as many colors as you want:

example:
gradient-type(
  color1,
  color2,
  color3
);

- You can specify where you want a gradient transition to complete by add it to the color like this:

example:
gradient-type(
  color1,
  color2 20%,
  color3
)

explanation
-> it will transition from color1 to color2 between 0% and 20% of the element and the transition
to color3 for the rest.
